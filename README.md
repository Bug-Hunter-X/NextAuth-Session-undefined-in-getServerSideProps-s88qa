# NextAuth Session undefined in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `getServerSideProps` with NextAuth.js in Next.js 15. The problem arises when attempting to access session data, specifically `session.user`, which may be undefined, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Problem

The `getServerSideProps` function fetches the session successfully, however, accessing the user object throws an error. This occurs intermittently.  The issue isn't related to the authentication itself, as the session is correctly established.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves adding robust checks to handle potential `undefined` values before attempting to access nested properties within the session object. This approach prevents errors and ensures that the application handles unexpected conditions gracefully.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables (NEXTAUTH_URL, etc.) as required by NextAuth.js.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
